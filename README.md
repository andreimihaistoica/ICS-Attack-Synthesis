This repository contains the prompt templates used for each of the three PLC models, as well as the scripts generated by each LLM.

The repository is organized by LLM. Each LLM folder contains a subfolder for each PLC, and each PLC folder contains all generated scripts for that configuration. Script filenames follow the format 0_T0848_easy.py, where the first number is a unique index, the T#### identifier corresponds to the associated MITRE ATT&CK for ICS technique, and the final suffix indicates the context level (easy = low, medium = medium, hard = high).
